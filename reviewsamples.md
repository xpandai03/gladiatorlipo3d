Dr. Jason Emer is LA’s very own cosmetics dermatologist very BEST. He is treating me for hyperpigmentation, possible neck lift and HD lipo in the near future. He is truly a master artist of Beauty: fillers, and SKIN improvement. He has a great staff. From his call center to Justin N. his sale rep is personable, caring and knowledgeable have great customer service skills. I’ve gotten a couple amazing facial from his esthetician, Amazing! He only carries the very best skincare products. My favorite from his beauty bar are The EMK Beverly Hills Rescue Serum and Alpha Mask, my fav. Oh did I mention his brand new state of the art office, never seen anything like it. Dr. Emer and his team of Doctor and Staff are the very best. Can’t wait for my next treatment.

I found Dr. Emer through instagram and loved his work so I scheduled a consultation and planned to get my buccal fat pad and neck lipo with him. The process went amazing, it was painless and very smooth and his team took amazing care of me and helped guide me through the entire process making it seamless. I love my results and will be back in a few weeks to get filler done with him, I’d highly recommend to everyone to schedule a consultation with Dr. Emer and go to him for all your work, will not regret it !!

Hands down the best of the best when it comes to Lipo! I've been working with Dr. Emer to figure out how to shape my sexy self! I'm a bit curvy and well with curves comes the dreaded chub over time. Unless of course you're a gym nut which I am not lol. I'm really happy with how everything went and will be coming back for a follow up session soon.

I had an incredible experience getting hi def lipo on my torso and chest by Dr. Emer. His artistry is unmatched. I’m a fit guy and I spent the last year and a half getting in the best shape of my life. I wanted to work with a Dr. to take my body to the next level, but I didn’t want fake abs drawn on me - I wanted a Dr. to reveal and define my actual muscles and body. Only two days out of surgery and I look like a Marvel character. I’m shocked at how little bruising or swelling I have, and the aftercare team and regimen has been awesome. Everyone at the office has been super communicative, warm,, and attentive - especially Michael, Mari, and Dalia. This is the most holistic care I’ve ever received from a medical team.
